# REST API Backend

This project implements an API backend using Flask.'

The API provides end-points that display expenses and incomes and that provide for addition of new expenses and incomes.

Included is a Dockerfile that can be used to containerize this REST API service. It exposes port 5000 on the Docker container.

This project borrows largely from the tutorial at (https://auth0.com/blog/developing-restful-apis-with-python-and-flask/), "Developing RESTful APIs with Python and Flask".
