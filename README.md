# Rest API Backend

This project implements an API backend using Flask.'

The API provides end-points that display expenses and incomes and provides for addition of new expenses and incomes.

This project borrows largely from the tutorial at (https://auth0.com/blog/developing-restful-apis-with-python-and-flask/), "Developing RESTful APIs with Python and Flask".
